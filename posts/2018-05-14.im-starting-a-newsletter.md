title: I'm starting a newsletter
featured: true

For the past few months, I've been looking for a new home to share articles, projects, podcasts, or other things that leave an impression on me.

I considered adding them to my blog, but I'd rather keep that for original, long-form content. Twitter on the other hand feels like shouting into an abyss. After further consideration, I think a newsletter will be the perfect fit.

Growing the Stack is aimed at anyone interested in programming, design, or other related topics. It tries to bundle content that inspires, content that triggers you to consider and try out new ideas.

I'm aiming for quality over quantity: three links, every two weeks. I've never curated a newsletter before, so I'm excited to see how this is going to pan out.
